# Parallel_Programming
Parallel programming technologies such as MPI and PVM are used in a distributed computing environment while threads are limited to a single computer system. All threads within a process share the same address space. A thread is spawned by defining a function and it's arguments which will be processed in the thread. The purpose of using the POSIX thread library in your software is to execute software faster.
