# Parallel_Programming
The main motivation for massively parallel programming is for applications to enjoy a continued increase in speed in future hardware generations. One might ask why applications will continue to demand increased speed. Many applications that we have today seem to be running quite fast enough. A good implementation on a GPU can achieve more than 100 times (100) speedup over sequential execution. If the application includes what we call data parallelism, it is often a simple task to achieve a 10speedup with just a few hours of work.
